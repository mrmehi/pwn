``
Every C program has 4 main components:
1 - Stack
2 - Heap
3 - Registers
4 - Instructions

``

``
At this point there are two main architectures that dictate how our program is compiled and executed.
1 - 32 bit 
2 - 64 bit

Registers can store 8 bytes or less.

``

``
In x86 architecture there are six general-purpose registers:

1 - eax
2 - ebx
3 - ecx 
4 - edx
5 - esi
6 - edi

There are also 3 other reserved registers:

1 - ebp (Base Pointer - Contains the address of the top element of the current stack frame)
2 - esp (Stack Pointer - Contains the address of the top element of the current stack frame)
3 - eip

``
The Stack is a data structure comprised of elements that are added and removed with two operations:

1 - push
2 - pop

Push adds an element to the top of the stack and pop removes the top element from the stack.
Each element on the stack is assigned a stack address.
Elements that are higher on the stack have a lower address than those on the bottom of the stack. In other words the stack grows towards lower memory addresses.
Whenever a function is called that function is set up with a stack frame. All the local variables for that function will be stored in that function stack frame.
